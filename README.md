# Edison Middle School Playground
Swift playgrounds on iPad demo given at Edison Middle School on 10/23/17.

Taken from [Bill Chapman's most excellent repo](https://github.com/wlchapman13/Joy-In-Learning-Swift-Playgrounds) (with permission, of course).

1. Introductions about us (Apple + Google) and Sphero artwork contest through demo of some code we wrote.
Why we do care about coding?

2. Bring sandwich ingredients and give an introduction to algorithms and the struggle with literal interpretation.

3. Introduction to Swift.
  - variables
  - for and while loops

4. Split into groups and do Intro to Swift interactive playground.

5. Explain Sphero art competition. Design the artwork that you want the Sphero to draw.

6. Designing algorithm, writing code.

7. All of this stuff you learned can do a lot more than control robotic Spheros. Using the same techniques we showed you todayâ€¦
  1. robotic etch a sketch
  2. drone app @ Agrible
  3. EVERYDAY THINGS THAT USE CODE: projector and thermostats and robotic shirtmakers use code!

  Once you learn how to code, all of this stuff is accessible to you! You can change it, break it, make it better :D

# Edison Middle School Playground
Swift playgrounds on iPad demo given at Edison Middle School on 10/23/17.  Taken from [Bill Chapman's most excellent repo](https://github.com/wlchapman13/Joy-In-Learning-Swift-Playgrounds) with permission.

###### Lesson Plan:
1. Introductions about Bliss Chapman (Apple) and Justin Loew (Google) from CocoaNuts.  Why we do care about coding?  What are we doing today?  1) Introduction to Swift.  2) Sphero artwork contest.

2. Make sandwiches collaboratively as an introduction to algorithms.  Students explain to Bliss explicit sandwich making instructions and Bliss breaks instructions during transmission to Justin.

3. Introduction to Swift variables and loops.

4. Split into groups and walk through the Intro to Swift interactive playground.

5. Explain Sphero art competition. Design the artwork that you want the Sphero to draw.

6. Design algorithm, write code, test with Sphero, and iterate!

7. All of this stuff you learned can do a lot more than control robotic Spheros. Using the same techniques we showed you todayâ€¦
  - robotic etch a sketch
    - [Drawing Lena](https://youtu.be/g2L0wQGVS88)
  - drone app @ Agrible
  - EVERYDAY THINGS THAT USE CODE: projector and thermostats and robotic shirtmakers!
  - What do you want to be when you grow up?

  => Once you learn how to code, all of this stuff is accessible to you! You can change it, break it, make it better :D
